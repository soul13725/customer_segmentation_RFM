# customer_segmentation_RFM
This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for customer segmentation and extends traditional methods using 3D visualization. By plotting RFM dimensions together, it reveals hidden patterns, overlaps, and high-value behaviors not visible in 2D, emphasizing interpretability for academic and analytics use.
